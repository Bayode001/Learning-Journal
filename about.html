            With several weeks of learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React in Scrimba

        <h2 class="post-header">How I stay committed to learning</h2>
        <p class="post-discription">
          Spending several hours in learning, with good effort in creating simple projects using what I
          learned or working new techniques into existing projects. <br />
          <br />
          While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I
          was learning and most things about my journey with the world as a Frontend Developer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="post-header">How I got started</h2>

        <p class="post-discription">
          Simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes
          about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my
          notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
          summaries of what I learned using my own words. <br />
          <br />

          That helped me with what I was learning, and I realized that posting
          my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
          motivated.
